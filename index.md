SCM software along with other Linux kernel developers.

## Why use Git?

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Many companies whose main product involves
software will use Git as a centralized version control system to manage the evolution of their
product.

Developers can use Git to track the history of their product, which helps with data recovery in the
event an error occurs.
