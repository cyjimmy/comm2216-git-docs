# Introduction

## Intended Users

## Prerequisite Knowledge

There is no required prerequisite knowledge to use Git. However, users are recommended to have basic
coding knowledge as Git is mainly used to store and share code.

---

## Software Versions

This guide is written based on version 2.35.1, the latest version at the moment.

The software can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Brief History

In 2005, BitKeeper, a source-control management (SCM) software stopped offering a free-of-charge
version to the community. Linus Torvalds, who had been using BitKeeper, decided to develop his own
SCM software along with other Linux kernel developers.

## Why use Git?

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Many companies whose main product involves
software will use Git as a centralized version control system to manage the evolution of their
product.

Developers can use Git to track the history of their product, which helps with data recovery in the
event an error occurs.
