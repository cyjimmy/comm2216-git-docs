<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our team created this project to support the journey of new developers who are starting to familiarize themselves with
Git.  The goal of this document is to provide users with enough information to perform basic version control operations
using Git.  For the purposes of this document, we will be using GitHub as cloud storage. In these instructions, our 
team will go over the following:
 - How to set up Git for the first time
 - Perform CRUD (Create,Read, Update, Delete) operations with Git
 - How to revert files using Git

<!-- PROCESS -->
## Our Process

### Group Collaboration
Our team had roundtable discussions to select a topic and decide on workload distributions.  We communicated primarily during class and on Discord. We provided feedback on each other's work on Discord and made a habit of notifying other group members once important updates were completed.  Our group took a collaborative approach in completing tasks and ensured we reminded one another of upcoming deadlines and outstanding tasks.  We used Git and GitHub as a means of version control.

### Our Experience During this Project

#### Using Markdown
This was our first time using markdown. We found it to be an easy medium to use as the syntax is straightforward and easy to understand.  Moreover, the code is easily detectable and errors are easy to spot.

#### Technical Writing
Our team made our technical writing accessible in a number of ways.  We used vocabulary that was pre-defined as per the glossary, and included helpful links to help our readers gain a more holistic understanding of how to use Git. In additional to technical terminology, our team uses everyday vocabulary that can easily be understood.

Moreover, all of our text is left aligned to maintain consistency, and blocks of text are broken up with other visual interruptions such as images or code blocks. Bolding, italics, and letter sizing are used to provide structure and context to the content.

#### Using PyCharm
Our team used Pycharm's built-in markup display to expedite the process of writing and checking our syntax.  It provided a way for our team to view our work as we were writing it so that errors can be spotted and fixed right away.

#### Using Just the Docs
Our team used a responsive Jekyll template for documentation to create our project.  It was a good experience in creating your own work within the template of another developler's structure and code.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
## Conclusion

At the conclusion of following the steps outlined in this document, users should be able to perform basic Git tasks such as setting up Git, creating a new repository, and reverting files back to it's previous state.

This topic was interesting but also challenging for us as there were some Git operations that our team was not too familiar with.  We enjoyed this project as it was a good opportunity for us to exercise our written communication skills while keeping the reader in mind.

A warm thank you to Sam Lee for this fun project.
